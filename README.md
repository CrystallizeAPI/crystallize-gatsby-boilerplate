      ```sh
      cd crystallize-projhect
      yarn / npm install

  2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

      Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

      _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

      Open the `crystallize-project` directory in your code editor of choice and make sure you'r `gatsby.config` has the following lines (among others):

```
{
            resolve: `gatsby-source-graphql`,
            options: {
                // This type will contain remote schema Query type
                typeName: `CRYSTALLIZE`,
                // This is the field under which it's accessible
                fieldName: `crystallize`,
                // URL to query from
                url: `${process.env.CRYSTALLIZE_API_BASE}/${process.env.CRYSTALLIZE_TENANT_ID}/catalogue`,
            },
        },
```

3. create a file named `crysallize.config` in the root of your project and copy paste the following:

```
CRYSTALLIZE_API_BASE=https://api.crystallize.com
CRYSTALLIZE_TENANT_ID=orn-forlag
```
